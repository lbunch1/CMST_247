1. What is the first weakness that I notice when  load the burger joint site?

The single column layout was not strategically implemented using excessive whitespace at the top pushing the important information below the line of the initial viewport.

2. What do you think is the most confusing feature of the burger joint site as shown in the video?

It is not clear that the items listed in the menu are clickable to add them to the cart for online ordering. They appear to simply be a list and there is no icon indicating that they are purchasable. It would seem more intuitive to have a quantity and add to cart button directly below each item with an alternative option to modify the item before adding it to the cart.
